# Soft_Margin_SVM_Question
Here are the R codes that generate a dataset and Python codes which show that the empirical risk may increase for increasing Î³ in soft-margin SVM (with the help of ChatGPT). 
In hw2_1(c), I miswrite $\gamma$ as $\lambda$ in the plots, but it should not influence reading.
Please see the newest ipynb file `SVM_question_new_v.ipynb` for better details.
